hashing_library:
===============

To use this library do:

import hashing_library

Once imported, the HashingLibrary and SimHash modules can be instantiated
and used within your python code. Note that this is a bare bones library 
and no other sophistication has currently been added. Further development 
will take place on these modules and they will eventually undergo refinement.
